# Development Page

A React/Vite testing environment for ForesightJS development and debugging.

This is the main devpage for ForesightJS and should be used for all non framework specific development.

This page is used by maintainers to test library functionality during development. It provides a live testing environment with immediate feedback when modifying the core library code.

## Running the Development Page

From the monorepo root:

```bash
pnpm dev
```

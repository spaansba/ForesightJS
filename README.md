ForesightJS is a lightweight JavaScript library that predicts user intent to prefetch content before it's needed. **It works completely out of the box without configuration**, supporting both desktop and mobile devices with different prediction strategies.

### [Playground](https://foresightjs.com/)

![](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f5650c63-4489-4878-bd72-d8954c6a739b)
_In the GIF above, the [ForesightJS DevTools](https://foresightjs.com/docs/debugging/devtools) are enabled. Normally, users won't see anything that ForesightJS does except the increased perceived speed from early prefetching._

## Download

```bash
pnpm add js.foresight
# or
npm install js.foresight
# or
yarn add js.foresight
```

## Basic Usage Example

This basic example is in vanilla JS, of course most people will use ForesightJS with a framework. You can read about framework integrations in the [docs](https://foresightjs.com/docs/integrations/react/useForesight).

```javascript
import { ForesightManager } from "foresightjs"

// Initialize the manager if you want custom global settings (do this once at app startup)
ForesightManager.initialize({
  // Optional props (see configuration)
})

// Register an element to be tracked
const myButton = document.getElementById("my-button")

ForesightManager.instance.register({
  element: myButton,
  callback: () => {
    // This is where your prefetching logic goes
  },
  hitSlop: 20, // Optional: "hit slop" in pixels.
  // other optional props (see configuration)
})
```

## Integrations

Since ForesightJS is framework agnostic, it can be integrated with any JavaScript framework. While I haven't yet built integrations for every framework, ready-to-use implementations for [Next.js](https://foresightjs.com/docs/integrations/react/nextjs) and [React Router](https://foresightjs.com/docs/integrations/react/react-router) are already available. Sharing integrations for other frameworks/packages is highly appreciated!

## Configuration

ForesightJS works out of the box with no setup required, but it can be configured both [globally](https://foresightjs.com/docs/configuration/global-settings) and per [element](https://foresightjs.com/docs/configuration/element-settings) if needed.

## Development Tools

ForesightJS has dedicated [Development Tools](https://github.com/spaansba/ForesightJS/tree/main/packages/js.foresight-devtools) created with [Foresight Events](https://foresightjs.com/docs/events) that help you understand and tune how foresight is working in your application. This standalone development package provides real-time visualization of mouse trajectory predictions, element bounds, and callback execution.

```bash
pnpm add js.foresight-devtools
```

See the [development tools documentation](https://foresightjs.com/docs/debugging/devtools) for more details.

## Prediction Strategies

ForesightJS uses different prediction strategies depending on the device type:

**Desktop/Keyboard Users**: Mouse trajectory prediction, keyboard navigation tracking, and scroll-based prefetching. [Read more](https://foresightjs.com/docs/getting-started/what-is-foresightjs#keyboardmouse-users)

**Mobile Devices**: Viewport enter detection and touch start events (configurable via [`touchDeviceStrategy`]). [Read more](https://foresightjs.com/docs/getting-started/what-is-foresightjs#touch-devices-v330)

## Providing Context to AI Tools

ForesightJS is a newer library, so most AI assistants and LLMs may not have much built-in knowledge about it. To improve their responses, you can provide the following context:

- Use [llms.txt](https://foresightjs.com/llms.txt) for a concise overview of the API and usage patterns.
- Use [llms-full.txt](https://foresightjs.com/llms-full.txt) for a full markdown version of the docs, ideal for AI tools that support context injection or uploads.
- All documentation pages are also available in markdown. You can view them by adding .md to the end of any URL, for example: https://foresightjs.com/docs/getting_started.md.
